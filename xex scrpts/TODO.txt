1) Use xenia to extract the default.xex, default.xexp and XLast file

2) Copy the files inside the script folder

3) Run extract_images_from_xex.py and then xenia_stats.py

4) Go into the folder it made and delete any png image that is not a achievement icon

5) Run fix_images.py

6) Push changes to repo and repeat.

Repo: https://github.com/wildmaster84/restored-media

Requirements:
	Python 3.8+
	xextools
	
Notes:
	fix_images.py just renames the files in order to work with the achievements.json xenia_stats.py made.
	If you can extract the default files and extract the XLast then you only need the 3 script files
	which would be the faster then using xenia for an extractor.
